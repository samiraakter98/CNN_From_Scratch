# CNN_From_Scratch
This repository contains a custom implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built entirely from scratch using Python and NumPy. The project demonstrates the core principles of CNNs, including convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling, and fully connected layers, without relying on deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. It's designed for educational purposes to help understand the inner workings of CNNs. The code is modular and easy to extend for experimenting with different network architectures and datasets.

Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute!
